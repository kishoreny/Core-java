   Notes:    1) Classes
                  This section shows you the anatomy of a class, and how to declare fields, methods, and constructors.
             2) Objects
                  This section covers creating and using objects. You will learn how to instantiate an object
                  and, once instantiated, how to use the dot operator to access the object's instance variables and methods.
             3) Member Variables and Methods
                  Member variables in a class—these are called fields.
                  Variables in a method or block of code—these are called local variables.
                  Variables in method declarations—these are called parameters.
                  Methods: Blocks of code, (called as functions in other languages).

   Notes:    1) Examples for Constructors
             2) The constructor (a method) is called when a new instance of an object is created.
             3) * Constructor declarations look like method declarations—except that
                * they use the name of the class and have no return type.
                * Constructor examples
                * Simple Constructor
                * Overloaded Constructor

   Notes:   1) Access Specifiers, to Class, Methods and Variables
            2) Default: 1) Classes can be at default level.
                        2) If no explicit modifier is given to a variable, class or method;
                           they will be automatically treated as Default.
                        3) Access is permitted from any method only in class.

                Public: 1) Modifier is given to a variable, class or method;Can be accessed by all
                        2) Class or methods are universally accessible
                        3) then that member can be accessed by any other code

                Private: 1) Modifier is given to a variable, class or method;
                         2) Member can only be accessed by other members of its class.
                         3) Subclass cannot access private members.
