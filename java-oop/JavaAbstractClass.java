 * 
 * > NOTES : Abstract Class
 *           1) A class that cannot be instantiated, is an abstract class. 
 *           2) It can have fields, methods and constructors are all accessed like any other class. 
 *           3) It should be used in a subclass 
 *           4) It is usually a parent class that contains common functionality across child classes, 
 *              Like Event Logging and common Utilities.
 *           5) It is usually a class that is too abstract to be used on its own.
 *
 *           Abstract Methods
 *           1) Abstract methods have only a method signature, but no method body.
 *           2) The abstract keyword is also used to declare a method as abstract.
 *           3) Useful in situations where the actual implementation of that method, is determined by child classes. 
 *           4) If a class contains an abstract method, the class must be abstract as well.
 *           5) Any child class must either override the abstract method or declare itself abstract.
 *           6) A class has to implement the abstract method, or else the abstract classes will be useless.
 *           7) To summarize, Abstract classes are used for Implementing Inheritance, where the behavior of 
 *              super/parent class could be extended/changed, Without having impacts to the child classes.
